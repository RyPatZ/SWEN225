* The way we implemented the player turns and loading of the game was completely different. (Constructor had to be changed)
* player.turn() had to be recreated. Lots of getters in the Player class had to be added.
* PlayerState had to be created, since player actions are not iterative anymore.

*These are just bullet points which may be useful for the report*
