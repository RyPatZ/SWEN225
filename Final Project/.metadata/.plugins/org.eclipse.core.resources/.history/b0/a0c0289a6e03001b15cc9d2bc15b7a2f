I found the lectures on git quite confusing so here is a resource I have made of git commands that will be useful for the project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ly2gnatI5rN-xMmtMcI_CspxJa5VQdsD-nfcOYJHLFg/edit?usp=sharing.

Please turn on assertions as the Maze class uses them for post-conditions. 

We are given marks on how well we use issues. So if you find an assertion fails add an issue saying what assertion failed and where. Also, add issues if there is something that you want someone else to do or to plan the stuff you need to do. I have covered issues in the git doc.



Packages currently contains empty classes as to commit push packages in git they must have something in them. Assets folder has a placeholder image and lib folder contains the jar files of some of the whitelisted libraries. Feel free to delete these files but make sure you replace them with another file before committing.
